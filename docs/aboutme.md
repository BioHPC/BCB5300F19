This is the course website for BCB-5300 (Fall 2019) at Saint Louis University.
The focus of this course will be on algorithmic and computational ideas in
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics --- it is intended for students with
a computational background and a reasonable level of mathematical maturity.
No Biological expertise is assumed, but Biology drives and motivates all of
the problems we will study, so you will be expected to learn the Biology that
is relevant to the topics we cover. We will us
