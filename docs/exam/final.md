### Overview

In this final exam, Iâ€™d like you to select a bioinformatics paper that involves clustering in a non-trivial
way. After you select and read the paper, please write a 1-2 page analysis of the details of how it used clustering, 
as well as the implications of how they used clustering. (Note that you may want to do a
bit more exploring and reading to understand the details of what they used, but the only formal
reading work is the one paper.)
